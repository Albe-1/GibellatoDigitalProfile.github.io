## About Me

My name is Alberto Gibellato, I was born and currently live in Bassano del Grappa, a city in the province of Vicenza. I'm a dedicated and motivated young programmer and systems engineering student in my fifth year at the Enrico Fermi Technical Institute in Bassano del Grappa. My other hobbies include basketball, video games, and spending time with my friends. My career objective is to secure a position at a company specializing in programming or website design, where I can contribute with my existing skills, and continue to grow professionally.

## Certifications

In the 2023/2024 school year, I attended an 8-hour course on workplace health and safety. During the course, I received training on general workplace safety, electrical and postural risks, eye strain related to the use of monitor, and the interpretation of safety signage.

## Internship Experience

I completed my PCTO at Kernel Computer, a small company located in San Giuseppe di Cassola (VI). During this experience, I had the opportunity to collaborate with other 2 members, which helped me gain valuable experience and further develop my IT skills by installing various software on customer PCs. Additionally, I acquired new skills related to manual PC assembly and maintenance by replacing broken components.
